# Shopify Products Scraper

This is Shopify products Scraper. The script retrieves data from the products.json file of Shopify shop. 
Then, for each product, it makes an additional query to the 
product page to retrieve data from meta tags.

All scraped information is saved to a CSV file (products.csv)

#### Why is this useful?

Unfortunately, the /products.json endpoint does not contain meta tags. To export all product parameters, it is necessary to query each product directly.

That's why a script was created. To do it automatically!
